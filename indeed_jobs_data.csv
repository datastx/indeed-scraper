    We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

  <div>
    But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
  </div>
 </div>
 <div>
  <div>
    Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

    <br> Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with 220+ million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. This is made possible, in part, by an engineering organization that enables our customers to stream content and our studio to produce content.

    The Mission
   </div>
   <div></div>
   <div>
    <br> The Auth Services team at Netflix is a central security team that supports the Netflix workforce and partners by creating and operating Authentication &amp; Authorization enforcement services for users &amp; applications. Our IAM use cases will continue to become more complex as we increase investment in Netflix Originals content production ecosystems, including Gaming. Our workforce and partners are global, and they access our information with different patterns from a variety of locations and devices. Balancing security and ease of access supporting fast-paced timelines, we realize that the traditional corporate network security perimeter no longer meets our requirements. Instead, we invest in Identity as a perimeter in the open internet, with reliable and strong authentication and authorization service to protect our information.
   </div>
   <div></div>
   <div>
    <br> The Role
   </div>
   <div></div>
   <div>
    <br> This role is a unique opportunity to contribute to building services from the ground up with security, large scale, high availability, high throughput, and low latency in mind! You will be part of the Identity and Access Control team, focusing on core Identity functionality to support all of the Netflix ecosystem (Enterprise, Studio, and Gaming). You will participate in implementation, operation and maintenance, tech debt reduction, and performance and efficiency enhancement efforts for some of our foundational services. You will be responsible for a mix of project-based development and operational coverage to ensure our services remain nimble. This is a great opportunity to learn and grow in this field while continuing to have an impact on improving our Enterprise IAM capabilities.

      We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

      Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
